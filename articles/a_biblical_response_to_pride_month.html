<p data-line-index="2">This is a response to the article that can be found from the source <a target="_blank" href="https://www.therogersvillereview.com/columns/article_e0ce1b1e-22a9-11ef-b26c-af9000d51821.html">here</a> or through the <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240613204215/https://www.therogersvillereview.com/columns/article_e0ce1b1e-22a9-11ef-b26c-af9000d51821.html">Wayback Machine</a>.</p>
<p data-line-index="4">Matthew 13:13,14 (KJV)<br>
Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand. And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:</p>
<blockquote data-line-index="7">
<p data-line-index="7">At first glance, Pride Month might seem at odds with certain interpretations of Christian doctrine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-line-index="9">Firstly, the issue in question is not a mere matter of interpretation of holy writ. There is only one correct interpretation of the passages relating to the sodomy expressed by Pride Month and the community behind it. Leviticus 18:22 (KJV) states, "Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination." Apart from linguistics, there is no interpretation required of this particular passage. Sodomy is an abomination to God. In an enumeration of related passages, there is not an exception which may be found.</p>
<blockquote data-line-index="11">
<p data-line-index="11">Traditional beliefs about sexuality and gender roles may lead some to view the LGBTQ+ movement with skepticism or apprehension. However, a closer examination reveals that the principles underlying Pride Month align closely with the teachings of Jesus Christ.</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-line-index="13">The beliefs in question have not been merely held by members of Judaism and Christendom for thousands of years as a matter of tradition with no foundation. They are held on the basis of the reading of clear scripture. The closeness of the merits of which are as close to those of Pride Month as the righteousness of Satan is to that of Christ. There is no comparison of the perfect love of God to that of the perversion of the LGBTQ+ community and their definition of love. Such a conflations demonstrates a lack of understanding of Jesus' teachings similar to that of the Pharisees. The words of his teaching is heard or read, yet is not understood.</p>
<blockquote data-line-index="15">
<p data-line-index="15">Central to the Christian faith is the commandment to love thy neighbor as thyself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-line-index="17">This is a true statement. Matthew 22:37-40 states, "Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets."</p>
<p data-line-index="19">It is human nature to be selfish and prideful. To consider the impact of one's actions to the extent of oneself. It is human nature to be totally and utterly depraved. Contrary to this is the law of God, which reaches into the very depths of the heart. After all, the mouth speaks from that which abounds in the heart (Matthew 12:34). An evil heart shouts the praises of self, pridefully shown on fully display. But a heart yielded unto God goes forth proclaiming praises unto him. From it is a drive to go unto the highways and byways proclaiming the Gospel truth. It is the heart that warns those condemned of their condemnation.</p>
<p data-line-index="21">John 3:18 (KJV)<br>
He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</p>
<blockquote data-line-index="24">
<p data-line-index="24">This foundational principle transcends differences of opinion or belief and calls us to extend compassion and kindness to all people, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-line-index="26">Similarly, those without Christ are condemned already and are therefore equally deserving of the wrath of God. Romans 3:23 states that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. Everyone has an equal need of the savior. But God, being rich in mercy, gave his only begotten son Christ Jesus our Lord that those dead in sin might be made alive in him by grace through faith. There is nothing that can be done to earn such favor; for it is the gift of God, so that no one can boast.</p>
<blockquote data-line-index="28">
<p data-line-index="28">In the Gospel narratives, Jesus consistently prioritized relationships over rules, demonstrating a radical inclusivity that welcomed the marginalized and the outcast.</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-line-index="30">Jesus consistently prioritized the repentance of radically corrupt sinners over the man made rules of the pharisees. Jesus ate with sinners not to show his support for their sin, but for the repentance of them and their households. Repentance involves a turning from sin and unto Christ. Jesus' earthly ministry is filled with examples of this very thing.</p>
<p data-line-index="32">There is not a single instance of Jesus affirming or otherwise supporting sin throughout the entirety of scripture. Rather, there is the persistent cry to, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand" from John the Baptist onward. A call unto salvation of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile. This call is to all who will hear and understand.</p>
<p data-line-index="34">John 6:37-40 (KJV)</p>
<p data-line-index="36">All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.</p>
<blockquote data-line-index="38">
<p data-line-index="38">Love challenges us to look beyond our preconceived notions and biases, to see each individual as a beloved child of God deserving of dignity and respect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-line-index="40">Mankind is by nature corrupt, of the devil, and deserving of wrath. God would be justified in sending each and every human being on the Earth to Hell today. Yet he has extended mercy and grace unto all who will hear the truth of the Gospel, repent, and believe.</p>
<p data-line-index="42">Ephesians 2:2,3 (KJV)<br>
Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience: Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.</p>
<p data-line-index="45">John 8:44 (KJV)<br>
You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies.</p>
<p data-line-index="48">Revelation 3:20 (KJV)<br>
Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me.</p>
<blockquote data-line-index="51">
<p data-line-index="51">It compels us to stand in solidarity with those who have been marginalized or oppressed, advocating for their rights and affirming their inherent worth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-line-index="53">It, however, does not compel to affirm sin of any kind. Be that sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, enmity, strife, jealousy, drunkenness, human sacrifices, divination, sorcery, necromancy, and such like. The love of Christ compels us to speak out against such things, teaching them that which Christ himself taught and calling them to repentance.</p>
<p data-line-index="55">John 14:15 (KJV)<br>
If ye love me, keep my commandments.</p>
<p data-line-index="58">Matthew 28:19,20 (KJV)<br>
Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.</p>
<p data-line-index="61">2 Timothy 2:15 (KJV)<br>
Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</p>
<blockquote data-line-index="64">
<p data-line-index="64">Furthermore, Pride Month presents an opportunity for Christians to reflect on our own journey of faith and growth. It invites us to examine any biases or prejudices that may exist within our hearts and communities, and to commit ourselves anew to the pursuit of justice and reconciliation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-line-index="66">The way to do this is not through Pride Month or anything similar. That is contrary to the proper interpretation of scripture. Instead, Jesus gave what is known as "The Great Commission" in Matthew 28:19,20. Christians should commit themselves unto the work of Christ, not the work of Satan.</p>
<blockquote data-line-index="68">
<p data-line-index="68">Ultimately, our response to Pride Month should be rooted in the transformative power of love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-line-index="70">Ultimately, our response to Pride Month should be rooted in the transformative power of the Gospel of Christ.</p>
<p data-line-index="72">Romans 1:16-18 (KJV)<br>
For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith. For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;</p>
<p data-line-index="75">Romans 12:2 (KJV)<br>
And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.</p>
<p data-line-index="78">It is not loving to affirm someone in their sin as they are condemned to hell. However, it is loving to share the gospel with them that they might come to repentance and be born again. Once again, the loving response is the Christian response.</p>
<p data-line-index="80">Romans 12:9 (KJV)<br>
Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.</p>
<p data-line-index="83">Christian love is to be genuine. The rest of the verse is a plain and clear instruction.</p>
<blockquote data-line-index="85">
<p data-line-index="85">It’s a chance to embrace the diversity of God’s creation and to celebrate the unique gifts and contributions of every individual.</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-line-index="87">Sodomy is not a gift, but is rather a result of the fall. However, this statement could stand in isolation as it echos Romans 12:5-8. Yet, contextually, it conflates homosexuality as an aspect of the diversity of the body of Christ, of which it is not. Diversity in the body of Christ refers to it being made of both Jews and Gentiles. Gentiles being people groups that are not Jews such as Romans, Greeks, and so on.</p>
<blockquote data-line-index="89">
<p data-line-index="89">As we extend grace and hospitality to our LGBTQ+ siblings, we embody the love of Christ in tangible ways, bearing witness to the inclusive and expansive nature of God’s kingdom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-line-index="91">Members of the LGBTQ+ are siblings of the children of wrath, not siblings of children of God. They should therefore be lovingly extended the call of the gospel unto repentance. For the wrath of God is fully inclusive of all manner of sins. A wrath that will be extended unto all who are not in Christ.</p>
<p data-line-index="93">Romans 10:17 (KJV)<br>
So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</p>
<blockquote data-line-index="96">
<p data-line-index="96">In the words of the Apostle Paul, “There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:28).</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-line-index="98">Yet another statement that is correct in isolation of its broader context. It contextually conflates the children of wrath and the children of God. Instead, the passage means that the body of Christ is one. It enumerates common labels of the time. A short study of the history of homosexuality, particularly at this time, will show its presence during the writing of the Apostle Paul's letter to the Galatians. Yet it is distinctly missing as a label in this enumeration of binary opposites. The only mention of sexuality or gender (which are the same thing to all not of a reprobate mind) is male and female. There is no mention of homosexuality in this list whatsoever. Furthermore, it would be incorrect to add homosexuality or otherwise include it in this statement when the broader context of scripture is taken into account.</p>
<p data-line-index="100">Galatians 5:19-21 (KJV)<br>
Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</p>
<p data-line-index="103">Yet more scripture references may be listed but would be redundant. None of these sins are listed in the prior passage, so homosexuality would be no exception.
